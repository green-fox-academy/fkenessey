                <h2>Fullstack software developer</h2>
                <p>I love to design complex systems with high levels of automation including AI and robotics. 
                        I'm deeply interested in inventing new things that can augment the human experience.</p>
                <p>Everthing I've done, everything I'll do today, everything I'll ever do, I do to protect this world.
                        Someone once told me that with great power comes great responsibility.

                <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. 
                    They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</p>
